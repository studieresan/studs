The project is a course called AI2151 and is worth 15hp. The course officially runs during the spring of 2016, but requires some attendance already during the autumn of 2015. The main purpose of the project is to establish a network with the companies involved, experience how it is to carry out a large project and of course the opportunity to experience a new country. There are going to be several obligatory events, which is worth considering before applying.
