        Studs is a project organized every year by a group of computer

        project to visit companies and universities. This year we are
        31 students working with studs.

        Last year the 2012 year's StuDs project group got to know and
        visited more than 20 different IT companies and the project ended
        with a fantastic trip to San Francisco where interesting companies
        such as Google, Facebook and GitHub were visited during a two
        weeks period.

        Are you are interested in getting to know 27 students soon to be
        graduated, with a Master of Science in Computer Engineering, who
        in the future could be employees or doing their final degree
        projects at your firm? Do not hesitate to <a
        href="%{contact}">contact our sales group</a> in order to receive
        suggestions of how we could work out an event which suits you
        perfectly!
      quote1: >
        The prosperous IT climate in Stockholm seems to me to be another
        verification that our position, timing and choice of education all
        “align”. During the last year we've visited big broad consulting
        firms as well as small front edge product companies, some refined
        IT businesses but also others where IT is an important complement
        to their core activity. It feels very exciting to become part of an
        industry with such broad possibilities no matter what your personal
        interests or orientations are.

      quote2: >
        The first stop was at Stanford University, one of the world's
        leading research and teaching institutions, and today, over 8,000
        students are performing graduate studies there. We started the tour
        with a walk around the campus grounds. Some of the things we saw
        were the Stanford Memorial Church and the newly laid class plaque
        for the class of 2012.
